# animated-bg-js
Made an animated background using vanilla JavaScript along with jQuery.

Contains some unused code for a cursor trail in index.js and style.css. Removing the css styling for the element used in the trail gives unexpected results even when the trail is not active, so I've decided to leave it in.
